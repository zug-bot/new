# Sprite Integration Complete! 🎮

I've successfully set up the infrastructure to use the character sprites from your image. Here's what has been implemented:

## ✅ What's Done

### 1. **Sprite Animation System**
- Created `spriteAnimator.js` with:
  - `SpriteAnimator` class for handling sprite sheet animations
  - `CharacterController` class for managing character states
  - Support for idle, walk, and attack animations
  - Directional movement with sprite flipping

### 2. **Updated Renderer**
- Modified `renderer.js` to use the animation system
- Falls back to static sprites if sprite sheets aren't available
- Integrated character controller with keyboard input

### 3. **Directory Structure**
```
public/assets/
├── sprites/
│   ├── characters/        # Character sprite sheets go here
│   │   └── knight_spritesheet.json  # Configuration for knight animations
│   ├── enemies/          # Enemy sprites
│   └── tiles/            # Tile sprites
├── backgrounds/          # Background images
└── lights/              # Lighting effects
```

### 4. **Controls**
- **Movement**: WASD or Arrow keys
- **Attack**: Space bar
- Character automatically animates based on actions

## 📝 How to Use Your Sprites

### Step 1: Save the Sprite Sheet
Save your sprite sheet image as:
```
public/assets/sprites/characters/knight_spritesheet.png
```

### Step 2: Configure Animations
The `knight_spritesheet.json` file is already set up with:
- Frame definitions (position and size of each sprite)
- Animation sequences (which frames make up each animation)

### Step 3: Run the Game
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎨 Sprite Sheet Format

Your sprite sheet should follow this layout:
- **Sprite Size**: 32x48 pixels for standing characters
- **Rows 1-2**: Walking animations (8 directions)
- **Rows 3-4**: Combat animations
- **Rows 5-6**: Special positions

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Characters
1. Create a new sprite sheet PNG
2. Copy and modify the JSON configuration
3. Update the renderer to load the new character

### Adding New Animations
Edit `CharacterController` in `spriteAnimator.js`:
```javascript
if (this.isJumping) {
  this.animator.play('jump');
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add the actual sprite sheet** from your image
2. **Create enemy animations** using the same system
3. **Add more animation states** (hurt, death, special attacks)
4. **Implement equipment overlays** for different armor/weapons

The system is fully prepared and waiting for your sprite sheet image! 🎯
