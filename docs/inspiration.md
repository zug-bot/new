# Art Inspiration and References

## Game Art Style References

### Triangle Strategy
- **Isometric Perspective**: 2.5D isometric view with pixel art characters
- **Environmental Design**: Detailed backgrounds with depth and atmosphere
- **Character Sprites**: Detailed pixel art characters with clear silhouettes
- **Color Palette**: Muted, realistic colors with good contrast

### Octopath Traveler
- **Lighting Effects**: Dynamic lighting and shadow effects
- **Particle Systems**: Sparkle effects and environmental particles
- **Depth of Field**: Blur effects for atmospheric depth
- **HD-2D Style**: High-resolution backgrounds with pixel art characters

### Sekiro
- **Combat Animations**: Precise, weighty attack animations
- **Parry Mechanics**: Visual feedback for successful parries
- **Enemy Design**: Distinctive enemy silhouettes and attack patterns
- **Difficulty**: High skill ceiling with rewarding combat

## Asset Sourcing Guidelines

### Character Sprites
- Look for 2.5D isometric character sprites
- Ensure sprites have clear attack, idle, and movement animations
- Consider licensing requirements (CC0, CC-BY, or commercial use)

### Environment Assets
- Isometric tilesets for terrain
- Background elements (trees, rocks, buildings)
- Parallax layers for depth

### Lighting Assets
- Light cone sprites for torches
- Shadow blob sprites for character shadows
- Glow effects for magical elements

## Recommended Asset Sources

### Free/Open Source
1. **OpenGameArt.org**
   - Search: "isometric", "2.5D", "pixel art"
   - License: Various (check individual assets)

2. **Kenney.nl**
   - High-quality free assets
   - License: CC0 (public domain)

3. **itch.io**
   - Search: "isometric sprites", "pixel art"
   - Many free and paid options

### Reference Sites
1. **Spriters Resource**
   - Sprite rips from commercial games
   - Good for reference and inspiration
   - Use only for reference, not in final game

2. **Pixel Art Tutorials**
   - Learn to create custom sprites
   - Understand isometric perspective
   - Color theory for pixel art

## Art Style Guidelines

### Isometric Perspective
- 2:1 ratio for isometric tiles
- 45-degree angle for character sprites
- Consistent lighting direction (top-left)

### Color Palette
- Muted, realistic colors
- High contrast for readability
- Atmospheric lighting effects
- Consistent color temperature

### Animation Principles
- Clear keyframes for attacks
- Anticipation and follow-through
- Weight and impact in movements
- Smooth transitions between states

## Implementation Notes

### Current Placeholders
The current implementation uses programmatically generated sprites as placeholders. These should be replaced with actual pixel art assets.

### Sprite Requirements
- **Hero**: Idle, attack, parry, dodge animations
- **Enemies**: Idle, attack, death animations
- **Environment**: Tiles, decorations, interactive objects
- **Effects**: Particles, lighting, shadows

### Technical Considerations
- Sprite sheets for animations
- Consistent pixel density
- Proper anchor points for isometric view
- Alpha channels for transparency effects

## Next Steps

1. Source appropriate character sprites
2. Create or find environment tilesets
3. Design lighting and shadow assets
4. Implement sprite animations
5. Add visual effects and particles
6. Polish UI and HUD elements
