# Art & Design Inspiration

## Visual Style References

### Triangle Strategy
- Beautiful 2.5D diorama-style environments
- HD-2D aesthetic with depth-of-field effects
- Detailed pixel art characters on 3D-ish terrain
- Dynamic camera angles during combat

### Octopath Traveler
- Stunning lighting and particle effects
- Mix of 2D sprites and 3D environments
- Beautiful use of bloom and atmospheric effects
- Rich, saturated color palettes

### Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
- Precise, timing-based combat
- Posture system alongside health
- Deflection/parry as core mechanic
- High difficulty with fair challenge

## Implementation Goals

1. **Art Style**
   - 2.5D isometric perspective
   - Dynamic lighting with real-time shadows
   - Particle effects for atmosphere
   - Color palette: Dark with vibrant highlights

2. **Combat Feel**
   - Responsive controls
   - Clear attack telegraphs
   - Satisfying parry feedback
   - Risk/reward balance

3. **Environment Design**
   - Layered depth with foreground/background elements
   - Interactive lighting (torches, crystals)
   - Environmental storytelling through placement

## Asset Requirements

### Character Sprites
- Idle animation (4-8 frames)
- Walk/run cycle (6-8 frames)
- Attack animations (3-4 frames)
- Parry/block pose
- Hit reaction
- Death animation

### Environment Assets
- Isometric floor tiles (64x32 base)
- Wall tiles with height variation
- Decorative elements (crystals, torches, pillars)
- Particle textures for effects

### UI Elements
- Health/posture bars with ornate frames
- Combat indicators (parry success, critical hit)
- Menu elements in fantasy style

## Color Palette

- **Primary**: Deep purples (#1a1a2e, #16213e)
- **Accent**: Golden yellows (#ffdd00, #ffaa00)
- **Danger**: Deep reds (#ff3333, #aa0000)
- **Magic**: Cyan blues (#00ffff, #0099cc)
- **Neutral**: Grays (#333333, #666666, #999999)

## Lighting Approach

1. **Base Ambient**: Low-key blue/purple tint
2. **Point Lights**: Warm yellows from torches/crystals
3. **Special Effects**: Bright flashes for combat
4. **Shadows**: Soft blob shadows under characters
