# Isometric Souls Prototype - Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes all the improvements made to the isometric souls-like prototype game.

## Major Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced Combat System** ✅
- Implemented a full Sekiro-inspired combat system with:
  - **Posture mechanics**: Both player and enemies have posture bars that fill when blocking/taking hits
  - **Perfect parry system**: Time your blocks just before enemy attacks for massive posture damage
  - **Attack patterns**: Enemies have varied attack sequences (high, low, thrust, sweep)
  - **Visual indicators**: Red danger symbol (危) appears before enemy attacks
  - **Execution system**: Break enemy posture for instant-kill opportunities
  - **Combat UI**: Health and posture bars for both player and enemies

### 2. **Advanced Enemy AI** ✅
- Created a modular enemy system with:
  - **Multiple enemy types**: Goblin (basic), Samurai (tough), Ninja (fast)
  - **State-based AI**: idle, pursuing, attacking, stunned, dead states
  - **Dynamic behavior**: Enemies pursue player, maintain attack range, and retreat when necessary
  - **Unique stats**: Each enemy type has different health, posture, speed, and attack patterns

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Effects** ✅
- Improved rendering with:
  - **Layered rendering system**: Proper depth sorting for isometric view
  - **Dynamic lighting**: Multiple light sources including hero glow and orbiting lights
  - **Particle effects**: Ambient floating particles for atmosphere
  - **Screen effects**: Camera shake on perfect parry, flash effects
  - **Parallax backgrounds**: Moving background for depth perception
  - **Fog and atmosphere**: Multiplicative fog layer for mood

### 4. **Asset Loading System** ✅
- Smart asset loader that:
  - **Generates placeholders**: Creates procedural sprites when assets are missing
  - **Styled placeholders**: Different colors and shapes for each enemy type
  - **Graceful fallbacks**: Game continues to work even without asset files

### 5. **Game State Management** ✅
- Complete state system including:
  - **Main menu**: Start game, view controls, credits
  - **Pause menu**: ESC to pause/resume
  - **Game over screen**: Death screen with retry option
  - **Victory screen**: Enemy felled notification
  - **Smooth transitions**: Proper enter/exit handling for each state

### 6. **Improved Controls** ✅
- Enhanced player controls:
  - **Smooth movement**: Acceleration-based movement with proper diagonal normalization
  - **Combat controls**: J for attack, K for block/parry
  - **Visual feedback**: Character bobbing, attack animations

## Technical Improvements

### Code Architecture
- Modular design with separate files for:
  - `engine.js`: Core math and isometric calculations
  - `renderer.js`: Enhanced PixiJS rendering system
  - `combat.js`: Complete combat mechanics
  - `enemy.js`: Enemy AI and management
  - `assetLoader.js`: Smart asset loading with fallbacks
  - `gameStates.js`: State management system

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient sprite batching
- Proper container hierarchy for rendering
- FPS counter for performance monitoring
- Optimized particle systems

### Visual Polish
- Pixel-perfect rendering with CSS
- Proper canvas scaling
- Dark theme UI
- Professional menu design

## Future Enhancements (TODO)

1. **Audio System**
   - Combat sound effects
   - Background music
   - UI sounds

2. **Level Progression**
   - Multiple levels/areas
   - Save system
   - Boss encounters

3. **Player Abilities**
   - Special attacks
   - Skill tree
   - Equipment system

4. **Content Expansion**
   - More enemy types
   - Environmental hazards
   - Interactive objects

## How to Play

1. **Movement**: WASD or Arrow Keys
2. **Attack**: J key
3. **Block/Parry**: K key (hold to block, time it right to parry)
4. **Pause**: ESC key

## Combat Tips
- Watch for the red 危 symbol before enemy attacks
- Time your parry (K) just as the enemy strikes for maximum damage
- Break enemy posture for execution opportunities
- Different enemies have different attack patterns - learn them!

## Running the Game
